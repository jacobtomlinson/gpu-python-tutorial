    "\n",
    "[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) is an extension to C++ which allows us to compile GPU code and interact with the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But I write Python, not C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last few years NVIDIA has invested in bringing the CUDA functionality to Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today there are packages like [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) which allows us to Just In Time (JIT) compile Python code into something that is compatible with CUDA and provides bindings to transfer data and execute that code. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many high level packages such as [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/), [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf), [cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml), [cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph), [cuSignal](https://github.com/rapidsai/cusignal) and more which implement functionality in CUDA C++ and then package that with Python bindings so that it can be used directly from Python. These packages are collectively known as [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly there is also the recently announced [CUDA Python](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-python) which provides Cython/Python wrappers for the CUDA driver and runtime APIs and is currently in preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will focus on Numba and RAPIDS."
